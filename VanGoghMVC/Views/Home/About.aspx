		<p class="text-muted">
			Van Gogh to You was created on April 23, 2015 with a mission to revolutionize the painting party experience by bringing the professional 
			paint studio right to you, wherever you are. We are a fully mobile painting studio with the sole intent of being fully mobile 
			from inception. Our goal was to develop a business that is convenient for the customer at an affordable price.

 			Your time, your place, your friends. Being around the people you enjoy provides the greatest environment for creativity.

			We currently serve a 100 mile radius around San Antonio, Texas, with plans to go nationwide in the near future. 
			We provide a higher quality result by combining cutting edge sketching software, traditional paint to canvas artistry, 
			and top notch artists to instruct and entertain. As a member of the San Antonio area, it is our mission to support our community. 
			We provide services for a wide range of events, including residential, business and charity events.
